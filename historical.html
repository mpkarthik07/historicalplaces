        The Red Fort or Lal Qila is a historic fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood of Delhi, India,
        that historically served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors.
        Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12th May 1638,
        when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi.
        Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori,
        who also constructed the Taj Mahal.

            The Taj Mahal  is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. 
            It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal;
             it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house,
             and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

            The Lotus Temple, located in New Delhi, India, is a Baháʼí House of Worship that was dedicated in December 1986.
             Notable for its lotus-like shape, it has become a prominent attraction in the city. Like all Bahá’í Houses of Worship, 
             the Lotus Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or any other qualification. 
             The building is composed of 27 free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of three to form nine sides,
              with nine doors opening onto a central hall with a height of slightly over 34 meters and a capacity of 1,300 people.
